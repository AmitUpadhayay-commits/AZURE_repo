1. Monitor Insights
    1.1 Health of the system which is running
    1.2 It also helps us understanding of the application usage
    1.3 Performance Testing

Libraries for Azure Monitoring of flask application:

1. Opencensus-ext-azure
2. Opencensus-ext-flask

Monitoring Tools:

1. Azure Application Insights---Application based
2. Azure Monitor------Infrastructure based
3. Azure Log Analytics
4. Azure Network Watcher

Azure Exporter:

from opencensus.ext.azure.trace_exporter import AzureExporter
from opencensus.ext.flask.flask_middleware import FlaskMiddleware
from opencensus.trace.samplers import ProbabilitySampler

Azure Exporter:

1. acts as bridge for telemetry data (traces) back to the azure application
2. opencensus

Need: Instrumentation key (which is similar to connection string of our storage)

Flask Middleware:

1.Azure----python code (Flask)
2.It does the process of intercepting HTTP request in flask and sents it back to the azure exporter

Probability sampler:

It acts as catalyst for sampling rate of traces.
